# TDDetective :tophat:

The atom package that sneakily watches you spiking functions and reminds you to keep it TDD!

```

## Usage

Once the package is installed, you will be able to activate it through the toggle option, which can be found by right clicking on the atom window.

The package assumes that your tests will be located in a '/spec' directory and works through matching the class name and method name with the relevant \_spec file, to ensure you're TDDing!

## Customisation

If you wish to customise any of the visual features, you can edit the tddetective.less file, which is located in the styles directory.
